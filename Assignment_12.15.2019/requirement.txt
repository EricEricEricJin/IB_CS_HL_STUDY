Design an algorithm and implement this algorithm in Python that works according the following specs:
Two players roll a die.
Ask the players for their name. Simulate the die with a random function.
If a player has a higher score than the other one, this player wins and the output should be <name player> wins with a score of <score>
If they roll the same number, they have to flip a coin. Result of this is either Heads or Tails.
Simulate this and store result in a boolean called Heads. 
If a player has Heads he wins and you have to output this with <player name> wins by flipping a coin to Heads.
If both player have Heads or both player have Tails they have to roll the die again.
If one player an odd number now, he wins. Output <name player> wins by rolling odd number.
If they both have an odd numbers or both have an even numbers, then ask the players to enter their age.
The oldest player wins! Output should be <name player> is <age> years old and therefor wins this game.
 
Requirements - Rules
- Two students per project. Choose yourself. 2=2, not 2=1 or 2=3. You know what I mean. Check your Boolean logic.
- No arrays can be used
- In Python variable declarations with datatypes and intialisations need to be shown commented
- Raptor, Pseudocode & Python implementation required.
- Proof of correct working of your Python code.
- Your Python implementation needs to be based on your pseudocode design and raptor design. They cannot be different!
- Report to be uploaded in pdf format on Schoology using the submission link supplied by Mr.K. with cover page, raptor flowchart, pseudocode, Python code & proof of correctness (test with screenshots of in and output!). 
- Grade awarded as classwork.
- No excuses for non delivery accepted. Grade awarded is 0%.
- Any issues: communicate with me up front!
